# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Ability to save/load models with text containing non-native symbols, by encoding the content 

### Changed
- Now the name of an element is a property of its own, instead of being stored just in the SVG (its view) 
- Added change:selection events, allowing developers to react to it.
Documentation added accordingly (docs/EVENTS.md.

### Fixed
- Fixed error when pressing ctrl+click on a non-actor element
- Refactoring
- Performance enhacement related to the Properties Table View
- Workaround for the "exploding quality" bug: whenever a quality was renamed, its
view got wider and covered the name.
This bug is purely aesthetical.
The view got restored after any (de)selection event.
This is just a workaround, a proper fix is still needed.
- Now it deletes the entire dependency link when deleting a depender or a dependee, preventing dangling dependums

## [Release v1.0.1] - 2018-03-05
### Added
- Changelog file

### Changed
- Update dependency (JointJS library): from 0.9.6 to 2.0.1
- Improved alignment of the 'D' symbol in a dependency link
- Improved fit-to-content feature when saving the model as image
  - Now it is also applied for the SVG file
  - Now it also trims empty space on the left and the top of the model
  - Now it is a bit tighter (less empty space)
- Improved handling of element focus:
  - Rectangle around the element to indicate that it is selected
  - The 'delete element' button was removed, to prevent accidental deletes
  - Fixed some bugs that could cause (i) accidental delete and (ii) blocked UI when adding a link
  - The user can now de-select an element (ESC or click on empty space)
  - Auto-focus on an element when adding it 
- Allow users to cancel an element/link insertion
  - Now the user can press ESC and cancel the action of adding an element or link. This is important since otherwise the UI could get blocked (for instance, if the user selected to add a link, clicked on the source, but didn't have an element to be the target).
  
### Fixed
- Fix limitation of 1.5mb for downloading PNG file on Chrome
- Fix incorrect behavior of changing focus when hovering over an actor
- Fix desync: when changing the label of a node through double click, the properties table wasn't updated
